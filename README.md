## Developer notes

- Any class that begins with "st" e.g `st-button` is a style added not using the tailwind css framework. These are for custom styles specific to Simply Tiling that tailwind cannot adequately provide.

- Most custom styles can be found in the main.css file in the assets folder.

- This project uses tailwind v1. Some functionailty such as group hovera nd group focus must be enabled in the tailwind config at the root of this project.
